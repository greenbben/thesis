First Playthrough

- Test notation and ask if it could be improved or general comments
- Watch one round by each pair
- Ask questions of what each person trying to do during the game
- Write down description of general strategy and moves that were fundamental to that strategy at end of game and real time
- Afterwards
	- Any issues or improvements to be made with notation
	- Does it slow down the game play too much
	- Ask questions if I don't understand someone's notation
	- Talk as a group about learning strategy and what was not obvious, learned while playing
